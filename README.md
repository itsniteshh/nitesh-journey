My coding journey with python


I've joined this #100 days of coding challenge but unlike last few times, I don't wanna stop in between and promise to myself that I will finish this challenge this time for God's sake
Topics and things covered in this #100 days will be:

‚ö° I will be using Python bootcamp zero to hero and python bootcamp 100 days challenge

‚ù§Ô∏è Next will be moving to Python Crash Course book tutorials and all exercises

üå± Then will move to Coursera's Python for Everybody Course

üì´ And finally, will be using different websites like geeksforgeeks and codewars for practise coding

:Will be updating all the courses here everyda even if it's for 1 hr or less coz, consistency is key.
